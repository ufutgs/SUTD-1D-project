Hi there! Is me, you! I wrote this...just in case, that me, or you, somehow lost your memory. If this is really the case, don’t panic. 
I peek the map before, there is a lantern at the left side of the maze. 
The lantern was supposed to be the holy item, usually lighting up when there is the cruellest survival match going on. But that is just a myth.
the gladiators were dead already LOL.#
Hi there! is me, again! Now I am inside of this giant maze, is kinda dark here, Drake and David seem to be very excited about this journey. 
We are not supposed to be here, since the maze is prohibited because of reasons like unholy places, a symbol of dark magic, blood...just some cruel stuff going on. 
But, as a historian, I won’t just give up. There is definitely some precious material I want from here.#
"kdilel Maze” was described as a forbidden, unholy place. 
Legends told how Kdilel Maze seem to be a place for the rich to host a particular game, a survival game, where several people compete against each other without any armour, versus a man with equipment that is deadly.
The only way to win the game is to light up the lantern, solve the puzzle, placing an old book, and picking up the key for the door.
Surely, there is a lot of trap, and of course, the killer, walker or whatever you call, will try to kill any survivors."#
"This cruel entertainment continued for a while until "X..." incident happened. 
A witch found this place filled with full of greed and lost soul. So, She decided to play one game, one last game."#
"As the game started, the killer, started feeling nausea followed by a seizure. 
With everybody in this game dead as how it would have been, things started to go wayward. 
In the first place the killer wasn’t supposed to be dead but now everyone is dead except for the witch herself. 
With the maze became her place, she started doing dark magic experiments and learning curses. 
From that day on, nobody saw her anymore whether dead or alive."@
